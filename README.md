## Reporting bugs
If you want to report a bug, open an issue and include your client.log file (Or copy the error text from it). 
The logs can be found by going to Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader and finding the link to the folder.
It may take me a while to see the issue, so don't expect a response immediately.
## Usage
With this new update, the mod has become much simpler to use. Taking a page out of UltraSonic's book, the mod now has a UI which controls its entire functionality and can be dragged anywhere on the screen.
The menu can be opened by pressing a keybind, which by default is "P". If nothing happens when you press P, you might need to manually set a key in the controls.
The menu starts on the main page, which may seem rather overwhelming at first, but hovering over everything will give you a basic description on what it does. 
However, if that is still not enough I will write more detailed descriptions here.

* The first two boxes are the width and height respectively. These are the dimensions, in tiles, of the pixel art. These values do not need to be set, and they default to using one pixel per tile.
It is important to note that a larger image will take longer to process and will require considerably more blocks, so I strongly recommend you do not go above 100x100.
